# Sudoku Solving
This project contains code testing out different sudoku solving methodologies. 
The code here is (barely) of prototype quality, and is definitely not of proper software-engineering quality.

## basic-solver
A python implementation of a brute-force, backtracking sudoku solver. Used for testing out logic, but decently slow.

## c-brute-force
A C++ implementation of a brute-force, backtracking sudoku solver.
